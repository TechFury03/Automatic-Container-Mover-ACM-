# Automatic-Container-Mover-ACM

**Introduction**

In this project I made a Automatic Container Mover (ACM) based on a ESP32s microcontroller. The casus was that the Rotterdam harbour wanted to become the worlds smartest harbour by using robots to move containers from containers to storage and vice versa. 

**Features**

- The ACM detects lines and avoids them
- The ACM avoids obstacles
- The ACM avoids a cliff
- The ACM can drive through a tunnel
- The ACM can drive uphill
- The ACM can be controlled via Wi-Fi 
- The ACM can detect a magnetic point

**Hardware used**

- ESP32s
- 3 Ultrasonic Sensors
- 2 IR-sensors
- 1 REED Contact
- 1 Breadboard powersupply
- 2 L293D Motordrivers
- 4 6v DC Motors + wheels
- Breadboard
- Jumperwires
